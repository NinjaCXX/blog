permalink: /projects/limited-supervision
description: Collecting diverse enough data, and annotating it precisely, is complex, costly and time-comsuming. To reduce dramatically these needs, we explore various alternative and complements to fully-supervised learning, <em>e.g.</em>, training that is unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, active, zero-shot or few-shot. We also investigate training with fully-synthetic data (in combination with unsupervised domain adaptation) and with GAN-augmenented data.
