title: Uncertainty estimation and performance prediction
permalink: /projects/uncertainty
description: When the unexpected happens, when the weather badly degrades, when a sensor gets blocked, the embarked perception system should diagnose the situation and react accordingly, <em>e.g.,</em> by calling an alternative system or the human driver. With this in mind, we investigate automatic ways to assess the uncertainty of a system and to predict its performance.
